# Welcome page, Login Page and Sign up page - Flutter UI Design
# Launcher Screen and App Icon change.

**Packages we are using for changing app icon for both android & ios:**

- flutter_launcher_icons: [link](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons)

Here, I've design 3 screens. First one is a welcome screen like then user open your app it shows then users have two options, if he has an account then press the login button and it just shifts him to the login screen or if he or she don't have an account then press signup button its transfers to the signup screen. Here, in this project, I've used flutter_launcher_icons dependency to change the app icon for both android & ios. Here I've also changed the launcher screen for android. I've taken help from youtube. Links are given below.
